# Chess-Knight-Moves-Calculator
A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board, given enough turns. This program finds the simplest possible way (path) to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way. The “simplest way” means the path with the least moves.
